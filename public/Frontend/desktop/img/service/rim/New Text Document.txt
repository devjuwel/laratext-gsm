Cleaning your wheels and tires regularly is not just an appearance issue – it’s preventative maintenance!

If you allow brake dust to sit on your wheels for a prolonged period of time, it can eat into the coating (if there is one) and pit the metal. Brake dust is made of an adhesive and carbon fibers that come off the brake pad and tiny metal shavings from the rotor. The intense heat and friction generated by the wheels makes this mixture highly corrosive. Because you probably drive every day, more brake dust is constantly being made. Frequent cleaning is the only way to keep your wheels safe. A good start is the Pinnacle Concours Wheel and Tire Kit! Check out our Tire & Wheel Care Page for more excellent tire and wheel products.
