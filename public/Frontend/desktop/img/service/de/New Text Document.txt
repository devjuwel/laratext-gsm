Removing car paint oxidation is an easy DIY job that we can do in a couple of hours. Oxidation occurs when the paint is not properly protected, and it can leave your vehicle looking years older than it actually is, with an unsightly white or chalky film. You dont have to change the color of your car to clean up the oxidized areas, and it requires no car paint removal at all. A few supplies from the store, some towels and some elbow grease will have the old paint job looking as good as new in no time at all.
