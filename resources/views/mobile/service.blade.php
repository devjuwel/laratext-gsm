            <h5>Exterior Car Care & Polishing</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="service_section_content">
            <p>
                Your car operates in an environment that impacts the quality of the exterior .The exterior is
                sensitive to a host of hazards such as road salt, pollutants and bird droppings. Any and each of
                these elements can eat away at the cars metal, chrome and paintwork. Washing and waxing regularly
                will keep your car looking like new. The paintwork - which includes a primer and numerous further
                layers including lacquer - works together as a system so a thorough process should be followed to
                protect the final finish. <br>

                Waxing a cars exterior goes a long way toward protecting the integrity and condition of its paint
                job. Wax penetrates deep into a cars paint, where it attaches itself to each individual paint
                molecule and acts as a protective barrier to environmental pollutants and contaminants. A good wax
                job also reduces the damaging effects of the suns ultra-violet rays on a cars paint job and limits
                sun-induced paint fading. In addition, waxing your car serves the following purposes too.

            <p>
                The interior of your car suffers daily wear which leaves marks and scratches on the trim and builds
                up dirt on the seats. Vacuum your car regularly and treat the dash with a protective product. Clean
                and buff leather seats and clean spills on upholstery quickly to prevent permanent stains. Keep in
                mind that regularly cleaning your car inside will mean that when you periodically send it for a
                detailing, the detailing firm will be able to devote their energies in deep cleaning and finishing
                rather than wrestling with the accumulated day-to-day dirt. Everyone likes a clean car and a buyer
                is likely to be more impressed with a car that looks well maintained
                <br>
                Whilst a good cleaning regime will ensure that the car is pleasant to occupy and will help in
                preserving the exterior, it is important to have it professionally cleaned on a regular basis. We
                use a comprehensive range of systems and topical cleaning products, designed specifically to address
                specific areas. The combination of the tools and products can in many cases achieve a far more
                thorough clean than those available in quick wash. Families in particular will know how tough
                children can be on car interiors, with feet marks on dashboards and on the rear of the front seats.

            <p>
                As plastic headlight lenses gained foothold over the last decade, so did the notion of hazy, opaque
                headlights. This issue is especially apparent on cars that are not babied all the time. There are
                various ways however to make your headlight bright and transparent again.
                <br>

                You can of course always take your headlight to a professional who will clean and polish the surface
                of polycarbonate lenses mechanically. But you won’t find these specialists everywhere, and sometimes
                it just feels right to fix something yourself – or perhaps you cannot afford or you are not willing
                to pay for the professional refurbishment .

                    Cleaning your wheels and tires regularly is not just an appearance issue – it’s preventative
                    maintenance!
                    <br>
                    If you allow brake dust to sit on your wheels for a prolonged period of time, it can eat into
                    the coating (if there is one) and pit the metal. Brake dust is made of an adhesive and carbon
                    fibers that come off the brake pad and tiny metal shavings from the rotor. The intense heat and
                    friction generated by the wheels makes this mixture highly corrosive. Because you probably drive
                    every day, more brake dust is constantly being made. Frequent cleaning is the only way to keep
                    your wheels safe. A good start is the Pinnacle Concours Wheel and Tire Kit! Check out our Tire &
                    Wheel Care Page for more excellent tire and wheel products.

                <p>
                    Removing car paint oxidation is an easy DIY job that we can do in a couple of hours. Oxidation
                    occurs when the paint is not properly protected, and it can leave your vehicle looking years
                    older than it actually is, with an unsightly white or chalky film. You dont have to change the
                    color of your car to clean up the oxidized areas, and it requires no car paint removal at all. A
                    few supplies from the store, some towels and some elbow grease will have the old paint job
                    looking as good as new in no time at all.

                    Ballistic nylon was developed to protect WWII airmen from flying debris and shrapnel fragments.

                    The 1680 denier fabric gives your seats heavy-duty protection from kids, pets, dirt and damage
                    -- in fact, its the toughest seat cover material we have found. They wont snag or tear, and a

                <p>
                    High-end car manufacturers install leather seat cover on car to make it perfectly sophisticated
                    in look. Leather is a porous natural material. It can easily absorb perspiration, odor, dirt,
                    oil, and grime. If proper care and cleaning are not given the leather seat will prematurely look
                    ugly and old. There are two essential elements that may damage the leather seat—heat and
                    sunlight. Both will quickly result to damage causing the leather to crack or fray. Therefore it
                    needs careful handling and maintenance to keep the appearance always fresh.
                    <br>

                    Leather cleaning for the car seat depends on how often you drive the car and how long it is
                    exposed to the sun. With these elements, you can decide to have your leather seat cleaned after
                    three months. This helps in retaining the good quality and appearance of the leather. It needs
                    attention and care otherwise it gets damaged if proper cleaning is not maintained. If you have
                    time constraints and you are not able to do the cleaning, then the role of specialist services
                    can be relied on.
